Developing a comprehensive credit card weekly dashboard requires careful planning and consideration of the key performance metrics and trends relevant to credit card operations. Here's a step-by-step approach to creating such a dashboard:

ðŸ”º Define Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Identify the essential metrics that stakeholders need to monitor regularly such as Total number of credit card transactions.

ðŸ”º Data Collection and Integration: Gather data from various sources such as transaction records, application databases, customer service logs, and fraud detection systems.

ðŸ”º Dashboard Design: Choose a suitable dashboard platform or tool like Power BI and design the layout of the dashboard, keeping it clean and intuitive.

ðŸ”º Visualization and Analysis: Create visualizations for each KPI using appropriate chart types such as line graphs, bar charts, pie charts, etc.
and include filters and slicers to allow stakeholders to customize the view based on time periods, regions, or specific product lines.

ðŸ”º Real-Time Updates: Ensure that the dashboard updates in real-time or at frequent intervals to provide stakeholders with the most current information.

ðŸ”º Accessibility and Security: Grant appropriate access permissions to stakeholders based on their roles and responsibilities.

ðŸ”º User Training and Support: Provide training sessions or documentation to help stakeholders understand how to use the dashboard effectively.

ðŸ”º Feedback and Iteration: Continuously iterate on the dashboard based on user feedback and changing business requirements.

By following these steps, we can develop a comprehensive credit card weekly dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card operations effectively.
